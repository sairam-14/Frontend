        While sometimes called "nature magic" by residents of the material plane, natural magic is a broader category than that name might imply, and it is found and used throughout the inner planes in many different forms. It's true that it is primarily tied to the physical aspects of the material plane, but it's also tied to the Feywild and Shadowfell, which are often seen as reflections of the material plane, and to the Elemental Planes. On the material plane it is most frequently used by rangers, druids, healers, and some clerics of nature deities. It is also the type of magic that is easiest for natives of the inner planes to learn to use; anyone from these planes automatically has a connection to this kind of magic and has the potential to become a powerful wielder should they choose.

        Elemental magic remains a cornerstone of fantasy. This involves manipulating the classic elements—fire, water, earth, and air—or expanding to include sub-elements like ice, lightning, or even metal.

Examples:
Avatar: The Last Airbender by Bryan Konietzko and Michael Dante DiMartino: The bending arts are tied to cultures, philosophies, and even personality traits, creating a rich elemental magic system.

Truthwitch by Susan Dennard: Elemental magic is central to the world, with characters like Tidewitches who control water and Windwitches who command air.

Ideas to make it unique:
Add rare or unexpected elements, like sound, void, or decay.

Tie elemental magic to a price—for instance, what if using fire magic burns away pieces of the user’s soul?

        Divination spells allow witches to seek knowledge past, present, and future events or information about the unknown through supernatural means. Spells that are related to Prophecies, and the creation thereof, also deal with events of the future. They typically predict future catastrophic events, which can further shape the outcome whether through direct or indirect means. Witches can employ a variety of tools to aid them in divination that range from bones and blood to even spiritual communication.

Vision Spell: A ritual performed over an object that will give the caster visions of doom.
Incantation: Invidium cala mactus.
Requirements: Salt Circle, Candles, Grimoire, target object, herbs/flower petals
Recalling Incantation: A necromantic spell used to recall the last moments seen by a deceased.
Incantation: Mala revelentur.
Requirements: The eye of the deceased.

    <h3 id="IllusionMagic" style="color: #7aeb09;">IllusionMagic</h3>
    <p style="color: #689938;">
        Illusion magic revolves around deception. Users create mirages, manipulate senses, or bend reality to trick others. It can be powerful when paired with stealth, intrigue, or psychological manipulation.

Examples:
The Kingkiller Chronicle by Patrick Rothfuss: Sympathy, a form of illusion magic, creates believable tricks by understanding physical connections.

The Night Circus by Erin Morgenstern: Illusion magic is central to the mysterious competition between Celia and Marco. They use their abilities to create elaborate, magical illusions within the circus

Ideas to make it unique:
What if illusions can only be maintained by taking memories or emotions from others?

Add stakes: If someone sees through an illusion, it physically backfires on the user.
